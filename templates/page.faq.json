If you can't find these measurements on the sunglasses' arm, check under the bridge.<br/><br/>•  Eye size measures the horizontal width of the frames lenses. Bridge size refers to the distance between the lenses. We measure temple size from one side of the temple to the other. This measurement includes the bend in the frame, too. Vertical eye size refers to the height of the lens. It is only of particular importance if your lenses are multifocal.<br/><br/>•  Be aware that most of the time, eyeglass frame are smaller than sunglass frames. This is not always the case, but it seems to be the general trend. If you're looking for sunglasses in a style like your eyeglasses they'll be similar sizes. Also note that sunglass frames with a curve to them (wrapped frames) tend to fit a wider range of people.<br/><br/></p>",
